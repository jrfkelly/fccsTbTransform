# fccsTbTransform
Scripts to transform Excel format TBs from the FCCS consolidation into CSVs, then manipulate the data into the format required for my TB Report.
This was written as part of an automation project for a client, as such no data will be stored in this repo.
These scripts replace a manual Excel process that took around a day and a half to run.
